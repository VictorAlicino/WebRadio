Installation
============

This document describes how to install the Web Radio application on any computer running Linux (prefferly Debian based distros).

Server Installation
-------------------

For the server, we are going to need Icecast and Liqudisoap, and optionally we can also use Nginx as a reverse proxy.

1. Icecast 2

    The official documentation for Icecast can be found on https://icecast.org/docs/icecast-trunk/

    For Linux users with Debian based distros, I highly recommend using the Advanced Package Tool.

    sudo apt-get install icecast2

    .. note::
    Make sure to use icecast2 version x.x.x.x or higher
