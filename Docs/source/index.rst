Web Radio Documentation
=======================

**Web Radio** is a project developed by LabIoT Team in Parque Tecnol√≥gico de Itaipu (PTI) under the SmartOffice project.
The goals is to create a personalized radio via internet for offices.
The radio server is based on `Liquidsoap <https://www.liquidsoap.info/>`_ and `Icecast <https://icecast.org/>`_. 
The radio client can be any device that can play a stream from an URL, but here you will find a Python script that uses the
`VLC library <https://www.videolan.org/vlc/libvlc.html>`_ in `Python wrapper <https://pypi.org/project/python-vlc/>`_ to capture the HTTP 
packages and play the audio.
