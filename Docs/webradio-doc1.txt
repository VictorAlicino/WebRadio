*Server Install*

For the server, we are going to need Icecast and Liquidsoap, and optionally we can also
use Nginx for reverse proxy.

---Icecast 2---

The official documentation for Icecast can be found on https://icecast.org/docs/icecast-trunk/

For Linux users with Debian based distros, I highly recommend using the Advanced Package Tool.

sudo apt-get install icecast2

NOTE: Make sure to use icecast2 version x.x.x.x or higher

/** ICECAST CONFIGURATION **/

---Liquidsoap---

The official documentation for Liquidsoap can be found on https://www.liquidsoap.info/doc-2.1.2/

NOTE: This documentation version can only be trusted for Liquidsoap version 2.1.2 or above

Liquidsoap can also be installed via Advanced Package Tool, but the official documentation
recommends installing it using the OCaml Package Manager (OPAM), so, let's install it.

NOTE: Liquidsoap official documentation also provides a docker container, see more at https://www.liquidsoap.info/doc-2.1.2/install.html#docker

sudo apt-get install opam

NOTE: Make sure your OPAM is at least version 2.0.
NOTE: Make sure your OCaml is at least version 4.12.0

For Liquidsoap to work properly you will need some dependencies, you can install all of them
in a single command, but make sure to get yourself some coffee, this is going to take a while.

NOTE: For a list of all the dependencies available, run opam info liquidsoap

First, make sure you have all the external dependencies needed in order to correct install the 
dependencies you want, this can be accomplished by running the opam depext command.

opam depext taglib mad lame vorbis cry samplerate liquidsoap

After that you can install,

opam install taglib mad lame vorbis cry samplerate liquidsoap

For Liquidsoap to be able to run as daemon, we need the liquidsoap-daemon package.
Clone the liquidsoap-daemon repositiry in a convenient path.

git clone https://github.com/savonet/liquidsoap-daemon.git

*Server Configuration*

---Icecast 2---

First we have to configure the Icecast.

Icecast configuration is done by a xml file located in /etc/icecast2/icecast.xml
Choose your editor of choice and open this file (you will need sudo).

sudo nano /etc/icecast2/icecast.xml

Look for this line:

 <listen-socket>
   <port>8000</port>
   <!-- <bind-address>127.0.0.1</bind-address> -->
   <!-- <shoutcast-mount>/stream</shoutcast-mount> -->
 </listen-socket>

you can change the <port> parameter to any port you want to be the Icecast listening port, this will be
used by Liquidsoap for send the stream to Icecast

To change the passwords you have to look for the authentication line, which look like this:

 <authentication>
   <!-- Sources log in with username 'source' -->
   <source-password>12345678</source-password>
   <!-- Relays log in with username 'relay' -->
   <relay-password>12345</relay-password>

   <!-- Admin logs in with the username given below -->
   <admin-user>admin</admin-user>
   <admin-password>admin123</admin-password>
 </authentication>

After that you can restart Icecast to load de changes

sudo systemctl restart icecast2

---NGINX---

If you want to use NGINX as a reverse proxy, you can create a new NGINX configuration file for Icecast

sudo nano /etc/nginx/conf.d/icecast.conf

Write the following to the file:

server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
    server_name YOUR_URL_HERE;

    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Server $host;

    location / {
        proxy_set_header Accept-Encoding "";
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000/;
        sub_filter_types application/xspf+xml audio/x-mpegurl audio/x-vclt text/css text/html text/xml;
        sub_filter ':8000/' '/';
        sub_filter '@localhost' '@YOUR_URL_HERE';
        sub_filter 'localhost' $host;
        sub_filter 'Mount Point ' $host;
    }
}

Save the file and run the following command to check for errors

sudo nginx -t

Restart NGINX

sudo systemctl restart nginx

---Liquidsoap---

For liquidsoap to work properly, you will have to modify some script lines

Inside the Server/scripts/ folder, locate the "streamer_config.liq" file, this file contains the streamer 
information, in our case, the Icecast.

In "streamer_config.liq" modify the following lines:

streamer_host = "localhost"
streamer_port = 8000
streamer_pass = "hackme"

Change the streamer_host variable to the Icecast IP, if it's in the same machine, you leave it as "localhost".
Change the streamer_port variable to the port you chose in Icecast.
Change the streamer_pass to the Icecast source password.
